Harvard University's introduction

to the intellectual
enterprises of computer science

15

27
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:16,920
>> So I made a mistake myself some
time ago when I started off college.

28
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:21,580
And I got to college, and I decided to
frankly, stick within my comfort zone.

29
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:24,475
I ended up declaring a concentration,
or a major, of government.

30
00:03:24,475 --> 00:03:27,880
Ant that was mostly a function of me
being pretty familiar with government

31
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:31,270
or at least history or I really liked
constitutional law in high school.

32
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:34,150
And so when I got here, I kind
of gravitated toward things

33
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,800
with which I was already familiar.

34
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,300
Right?

35
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,167
God forbid I do poorly in the class.

36
00:03:38,167 --> 00:03:40,250
I certainly wanted to stay
within my comfort zone,

37
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:43,010
and it wasn't until
sophomore year that I finally

38
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:46,820
got up the nerve to step foot
in a classroom called CS50.

39
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:51,150
And at that point, did I finally realize
that, my God, homework could actually

40
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:51,910
be fun.

41
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:54,410
>> Indeed, I was one of those kids
that on Friday evenings when

42
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:57,640
the P-SETS would be released, I
would go back to my room and dive

43
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,790
into the night's P-SETS.

44
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:01,606
And for me, that was a sign
that this was a field for me.

45
00:04:01,606 --> 00:04:04,480
But what was more important was the
fact that I did get up this nerve

46
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,000
to explore waters unfamiliar to me
and get beyond my own comfort zone

47
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,320
and frankly, I only was able to do that
sophomore year by taking this class

48
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,050
pass/fail.

49
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:16,470
>> Indeed, it was the very last day that
I finally switched over and finally

50
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:19,707
declared CS as my concentration,
putting gov at that point behind me.

51
00:04:19,707 --> 00:04:22,290
And so we're not setting out in
this course to turn all of you

52
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:25,780
into CS majors or concentrators, but
rather to give you an opportunity

53
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:29,780
to hopefully go beyond the world
with which you're currently familiar

54
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:33,660
and bring back from this world
skills and knowledge and savvy

55
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:36,220
that you can apply to your
own world, whether that's

56
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:39,080
in the humanities, social sciences,
natural sciences, or beyond.

57
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,871
>> Indeed, if you're
feeling a little intrepid

58
00:04:40,871 --> 00:04:43,250
about being in this room
let alone in this class,

59
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:47,560
realize that if history is
any indication, 72% of you

60
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,802
have never taken a CS course before.

61
00:04:49,802 --> 00:04:52,760
So it is by all means not the case
that the student sitting to the left

62
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:56,850
or to the right or in front or
behind you knows far more about CS

63
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:58,820
or programming in particular than you.

64
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,432
That's not in fact the case.

65
00:05:00,432 --> 00:05:02,140
And indeed, much of
the support structure

66
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:04,600
that we've set up in this
course over the past many years

67
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,840
has been for exactly that reason-- to
provide an on ramp that still exits

68
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,640
just as rigorously and
just as high as ever--

69
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:14,860
but the slope of which allow students
less comfortable and more comfortable

70
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:18,420
alike to succeed irrespective
of his or her prior background.

71
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:20,610
>> Indeed, what ultimately
matters in this class is not

72
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:22,830
so much where you end up
relative to your classmates

73
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:26,000
but where you in week 12
end up relative to yourself

74
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,720
in week zero, which is
where we are here today.

75
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,315
>> Indeed and this may very well
and probably does look like Greek

76
00:05:32,315 --> 00:05:32,940
to many of you.

77
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:35,200
But rest assured, that
this and so much more

78
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,990
is going to be completely within your
grasp in just a little bit of time.

79
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:41,410
>> But today, we focus on some
of the higher level ideas

80
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:43,822
to give you a taste of
CS50 and computer science

81
00:05:43,822 --> 00:05:45,530
in a sense of what
you're signing up for.

82
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:48,000
And indeed, computer science
might be distilled more

83
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,209
simply as computational thinking--
thinking like a computer, if you will.

84
00:05:51,209 --> 00:05:54,000
And there's so many different things
ingredients that go into that,

85
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,240
but let's propose just three for today.

86
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,420
If the goal of the class ultimately
is not to teach you programming,

87
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:03,022
is not to teach you C or PHP or
SQL or any number of the words

88
00:06:03,022 --> 00:06:04,730
and acronyms in the
course's description,

89
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:07,850
but rather to teach you to
solve problems more effectively

90
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:11,670
and to think more methodically and
more algorithmically, so to speak.

91
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:13,610
Let's see what exactly this means.

92
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:17,000
>> So I would propose that thinking
computationally boils down

93
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,834
to solving problems.

94
00:06:17,834 --> 00:06:19,333
What do you need to solve a problem?

95
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:21,470
You need to input-- like
the input to the problem--

96
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:23,636
you need an output, which
is hopefully the solution,

97
00:06:23,636 --> 00:06:26,720
and then you need a process by
which to solve that problem, which

98
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,030
we'll call an algorithm-- a set of
instructions for solving some problem.

99
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:33,340
>> But first, let's focus on the first and
the last of these inputs and outputs.

100
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:38,070
Computers after all, apparently
only understands zeros and ones.

101
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,299
But how can that possibly be?

102
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:42,090
Even if you're not familiar at all
with what's underneath the hood,

103
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:44,980
you probably at least heard that
computers understand binary--

104
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:48,050
just zeros and ones-- but how can
you possibly do anything interesting?

105
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:49,960
>> Well, one of the themes
of the class is going

106
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:53,293
to be this layering-- where today, we'll
take a quick glance at the lowest level

107
00:06:53,293 --> 00:06:55,620
details, but with each
passing day, where we layer

108
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:59,420
or abstract on top of those details
to actually solve higher level

109
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,080
problems of interest to us.

110
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:04,730
>> So here is what we might call binary--
with just an alphabet of 0 and 1.

111
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:06,960
But we humans are mostly
familiar with decimal.

112
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,130
Dec meaning 10.

113
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:09,070
Bi meaning two.

114
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:12,100
And so in the decimal
system, we have 10 digits

115
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,099
at our disposal-- of
course, zero through nine.

116
00:07:14,099 --> 00:07:16,140
So if you look at a number
like this, most of you

117
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:19,016
intuitively just grasp that is 123.

118
00:07:19,016 --> 00:07:20,640
There's nothing really hard about that.

119
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,452
But why is it 123?

120
00:07:22,452 --> 00:07:24,660
Well, if you think back to
grade school-- or at least

121
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,410
the way I learned this
kind of world-- you

122
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:29,640
might recall that we treated these
things in columns, or places.

123
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,412
>> So we have the ones place on the right.

124
00:07:31,412 --> 00:07:32,620
The tens place in the middle.

125
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,240
The hundreds place on the left.

126
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,980
And then how do we get
from this pattern symbols--

127
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:41,771
1 2 3-- to this higher level
idea that we know as 123?

128
00:07:41,771 --> 00:07:43,461
Well, it's just some simple arithmetic.

129
00:07:43,461 --> 00:07:43,960
Right?

130
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:48,960
>> The one there is essentially means
give us 100 times 1 plus 10 times

131
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,410
2 plus 1 times 3.

132
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:53,430
And of course if we do out the
math there, it's 100 plus 20

133
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:56,480
plus 3-- otherwise known as 123.

134
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,820
>> So if you're on the
same page as that right

135
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:02,320
now and are comfortable with the
so-called decimal system as a human,

136
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:05,750
it's actually well within
your scope of comfort

137
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,220
to consider now the binary system.

138
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:10,110
Take a wild guess-- this represents,
in the world of computers

139
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:12,001
in binary-- what number?

140
00:08:12,001 --> 00:08:12,500
Zero.

141
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,580
>> But why is that?

142
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:17,460
Well, it turns out that the columns or
places here-- they're not powers of 10.

143
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,670
1, 10, 100, 1,000, and so forth.

144
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:21,890
They're instead, quite
simply, powers of 2.

145
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:25,400
So, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and so on.

146
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:29,630
And so now we of course get to 0
here simply because we have 4 times

147
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:34,510
0 plus 2 times 0 plus 1 times
0, which of course gives us 0.

148
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:37,399
>> But how do I go about
representing the number 1?

149
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:39,440
What's the pattern of
zeros and ones to represent

150
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,720
the number we humans know as 1?

151
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,280
001.

152
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,370
And 2?

153
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:47,480
010.

154
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,760
>> And now the pattern starts to repeats.

155
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,890
Now it's 011.

156
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:54,310
And again, 0 fours, one 2, one 1.

157
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:55,180
So 2 plus 1.

158
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:56,140
That's 3.

159
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:59,069
>> And now to represent 4, we
don't just change that 0 to a 1.

160
00:08:59,069 --> 00:09:01,360
You sort of have to carry,
so to speak, and the numbers

161
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,700
start flipping around just
like in the decimal world.

162
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:04,670
>> So this is 4.

163
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:05,410
This is 5.

164
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:06,330
This is 6.

165
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:07,580
This is 7.

166
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,720
And so we've counted as high as 7.

167
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,400
>> Now all we just need is more a
bits-- more zero's and one's.

168
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,700
And indeed "bits", if you've
heard this term-- binary digit.

169
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,470
Bit is where that comes from.

170
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:20,190
And so if we want to represent
bigger numbers, we need more bits.

171
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:24,360
But let's move away from slides now
to something a little more real.

172
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,540
Suppose that we want to
actually represent this thing.

173
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:31,790
>> Well let's take a look now
at a little demonstration.

174
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:35,270
So this is a web based application
that one of CS50's own, Michael G,

175
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:38,160
put together this summer to help
us elucidate exactly this idea.

176
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,420
And would someone like
to venture up on stage

177
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:42,915
in front of all his or her classmates?

178
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:43,790
Right there in front.

179
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:45,660
Come on up.

180
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:48,350
>> You have to be comfortable
on camera and the internet.

181
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:50,930

182
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:52,450
Oh, right here.

183
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:52,950
OK.

184
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:53,740
We're OK.

185
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:54,240
All right.

186
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:54,740
Come on up.

187
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:56,150
What's your name?

188
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:58,550
Emily come on up.

189
00:09:58,550 --> 00:09:59,410
So this is Emily.

190
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:00,840
What year are you?

191
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,660
>> Freshman.

192
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:02,810
>> Emily, nice to meet you.

193
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:03,310
David.

194
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:03,810
>> All right.

195
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:06,120
So up on the screen here,
we have this touch screen

196
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,425
which is going to allow us to
actually interact with this program,

197
00:10:08,425 --> 00:10:09,265
and it's just a browser.

198
00:10:09,265 --> 00:10:11,390
It's Chrome full screened
at the moment, but it's

199
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:14,030
been programmed by Michael to
respond in a way that allows

200
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,970
us to play around with binary digits.

201
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:20,220
>> So for instance, here we have not
three but eight bits-- zeros and ones.

202
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,000
Right now, we're
looking at the number 0.

203
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,150
And indeed, all eight zeros
in decimal means zero.

204
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:26,900
So that's all that's
being hinted at here.

205
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:29,395
>> So if you wanted to
represent the number 8,

206
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:31,520
what's the pattern of zeros
and ones that you want?

207
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:35,160
You can simply tap up or down
or the numbers themselves.

208
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:35,660
All right.

209
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:37,659
So that of course is 8,
as you can see up there.

210
00:10:37,659 --> 00:10:41,260
And if we wanted to
do 16, what do we do?

211
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:42,701
>> Yep, just touch it again.

212
00:10:42,701 --> 00:10:43,200
16.

213
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:43,870
All right.

214
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:46,522
So this is all fine and good,
it's still very low level.

215
00:10:46,522 --> 00:10:48,230
We need a way in the
real world for Emily

216
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:50,550
of actually representing these things.

217
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:54,230
And so suppose that we turn these
zeros and ones, which is very

218
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:55,980
conceptual, into actual light bulbs.

219
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:56,480
Right?

220
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,540
>> A computer is a physical,
mechanical, electrical device.

221
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:02,220
And its input-- at least if
you plug it in or charge it--

222
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:05,090
is to have battery power and
electrons flowing in and out.

223
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:08,150
>> So now, why don't we stop thinking
about bits as zeros and ones,

224
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:10,470
but something more physical
like light bulbs here.

225
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:13,815
And if Dan Armendariz could join
me for just a moment-- come on up--

226
00:11:13,815 --> 00:11:15,440
we're going to queue up an application.

227
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:15,940
>> Come on over, Emily.

228
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:18,270
Sorry this is the most
awkward demo for you ever.

229
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:20,330
Come on over here.

230
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:22,080
We're going to queue
up with thanks to Dan

231
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:25,300
Armendariz, another member of our staff,
an application known as binary bulb.

232
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:28,070
>> So what we have here
is an iPad application

233
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:31,970
that has the following user
interface on the screen for Emily.

234
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:35,400
It's just got the same exact UI
essentially that's over there.

235
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:39,220
And if you now want to
represent the number, say 8,

236
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:42,094
how would you go about doing
this noticing at the right,

237
00:11:42,094 --> 00:11:43,510
the light bulbs that we have here?

238
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:46,576

239
00:11:46,576 --> 00:11:47,620
Ah-ha.

240
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:48,290
Magical.

241
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:51,830
So if we want to now turn this into
something a little more challenging,

242
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:58,100
and let's go ahead and pick a random
number like the number 50 here.

243
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,015
Input this.

244
00:11:59,015 --> 00:12:01,640
And if you can now be challenged
to come up with the number 50,

245
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:04,268
we'll have a fabulous prize for you.

246
00:12:04,268 --> 00:12:06,144
>> EMILY: OK.

247
00:12:06,144 --> 00:12:08,692
Oh my God.

248
00:12:08,692 --> 00:12:10,650
DAVID MALAN: Arithmetic
is indeed hard in front

249
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:12,860
of hundreds of your classmates.

250
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:16,260
But 50 has been the answer here.

251
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:18,132
>> [APPLAUSE]

252
00:12:18,132 --> 00:12:21,875
>> And so now, this is meant to
be demonstrative for Emily.

253
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:24,315
So, in here, is some light
bulbs quite like these,

254
00:12:24,315 --> 00:12:26,190
but it's actually the
little magnetic strips.

255
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:28,570
And what's cool about these and
the reason we use them in CS50

256
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:31,640
is that they support something called
an API-- an application programming

257
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:34,681
interface, which is just a fancy way
of saying that what one of our staff

258
00:12:34,681 --> 00:12:37,284
did over the summer was create
an iPad application here

259
00:12:37,284 --> 00:12:39,700
that talks over the internet
to the light bulbs over here,

260
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,810
which are wirelessly
connected to another device.

261
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:43,912
But this is now an option
for final projects.

262
00:12:43,912 --> 00:12:46,370
And so Emily, if you would so
like, at the end of the term,

263
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:48,703
you can adorn your dorm room
in the meantime with those.

264
00:12:48,703 --> 00:12:50,376
Thank you to Emily as well.

265
00:12:50,376 --> 00:12:53,244
>> [APPLAUSE]

266
00:12:53,244 --> 00:12:56,590

267
00:12:56,590 --> 00:13:00,055
>> But now, let's turn
our attention to what

268
00:13:00,055 --> 00:13:03,180
that message might have looked like,
and it's a little something like this.

269
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:05,320
In fact, this is an
example just as a teaser

270
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:08,400
of what's to come of what's
called an API request.

271
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,409
And so what we have here is simply
exactly the kinds of message

272
00:13:11,409 --> 00:13:13,200
that after a few weeks
time in CS50, you'll

273
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,590
be able to send to something fairly
familiar like that to actually

274
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:18,100
turn them on and off.

275
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,350
But this is all fine and good.

276
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:19,850
Right?

277
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:22,710
We have the mental model hopefully
for representing numbers with

278
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:23,660
zero's and one's.

279
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:26,290
And from zeros and ones, we can
get to higher numbers like 50,

280
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:29,460
as Emily just did, or we
can move up from that.

281
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:32,160
And I claim that we can represent
things like letters as well.

282
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:32,660
Right?

283
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:35,360
>> Computers are far more
interesting than just numbers.

284
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,340
And so how do you go
about representing words

285
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:39,420
on the screen or emails
or essays or the like?

286
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:43,170
Well, it turns out that computers simply
abstract on top of these low level

287
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:47,380
details, and humans some time ago, came
up with an arbitrary, but a consistent,

288
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:51,710
mapping of numbers to letters-- so
that any time you see a capital letter

289
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:54,170
A on your computer
screen, odds are what's

290
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:57,370
underneath the hood is a
pattern of zeros and ones

291
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:00,650
that represent the number,
per this chart, 65.

292
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:02,830
>> And more physically
inside of your computer,

293
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:06,450
are millions of things called
transistors-- these days-- which

294
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:10,190
are just switches if you will, things
that can go on and off and so imagine.

295
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:14,130
Not eight of these large light bulbs
but millions of these tiny little light

296
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:17,490
bulbs, or switches or transistors,
that can turn on and off

297
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:19,170
based on how you program them.

298
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:22,120
And so now we have a way of
representing letters as well.

299
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:25,300
>> In fact, if I were to use this
mapping here and try to actually

300
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:28,731
spell something out, we might look
at this pattern of decimal digits

301
00:14:28,731 --> 00:14:29,230
right now.

302
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:31,354
So we're not going to even
focus on binary anymore.

303
00:14:31,354 --> 00:14:35,910
Let's just consider these as
decimal number 72, 73, 33.

304
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:38,044
But what might this represent?

305
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:39,960
Anyone have a sufficiently
photographic memory

306
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:43,060
to know what's spelled
on the screen here?

307
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:43,560
Yeah a few.

308
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,190
So hi.

309
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:48,330
H-I and then an exclamation point,
which was not actually on the screen.

310
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:51,060
But indeed there's a mapping
for every letter to every number

311
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:53,340
that you might want to
type on your keyboard.

312
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:55,430
>> But numbers don't have to
represent just letters.

313
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:55,930
Right?

314
00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:59,570
All of us know about images
and photographs and audio files

315
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:00,870
and video files and the like.

316
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:03,580
So clearly we can represent
higher level things still.

317
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:06,920
And so what a computer
does is simply choose

318
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:11,240
to interpret patterns of zero ones
differently based on the context.

319
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,130
>> If you double click a
Microsoft Word icon,

320
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:15,900
you see words on the screen
instead of colors and pictures

321
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:18,850
because word knows that this is an
essay that you've actually typed.

322
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:21,510
If you instead double click
on a JPEG or a GIF or a PNG,

323
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:27,070
it opens up and is an image because the
.PNG or the .docx or whatever the file

324
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:30,450
extension is and whatever software
you're using knows to interpret

325
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:34,420
a pattern of zeros and ones differently
based on what its purpose in life is.

326
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:37,330
>> So for instance, this
same sequence of numbers

327
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:41,250
might represent how much red do you
want, how much green do you want,

328
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,810
and how much blue do you want.

329
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:47,490
And indeed, if you've ever heard
RGB-- so just red green blue.

330
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:51,380
And so if I see numbers like, this
give me 72 red, give me 73 green,

331
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:56,910
and 33 blue, this is how a
computer using three bytes-- where

332
00:15:56,910 --> 00:16:01,470
a byte is eight bits or 24 bits--
would represent a pretty nasty shade

333
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:03,660
of brown or yellow here.

334
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:07,500
And in different contexts, could those
exact same patterns in zeros and ones

335
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,780
mean something completely
different as well.

336
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:13,899
>> So we have now a way of representing
information-- zeros and ones.

337
00:16:13,899 --> 00:16:15,190
On top of that, we get letters.

338
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:16,860
On top of that, we might get colors.

339
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:19,730
And let's assume for today
that we can get audio and video

340
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:22,590
and things so much more
sophisticated than that.

341
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:25,370
>> But now let's consider
how we use those inputs

342
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:27,390
and produce those
outputs now that we have

343
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:29,830
a way of representing that information.

344
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:31,820
Well, we need something
called an algorithm.

345
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:34,320
Again, a set of instructions
for solving some problem

346
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,580
step by step-- and the
more precise, the better.

347
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:42,090
>> And so an example with which humans are
admittedly less familiar these days,

348
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:44,300
but nonetheless is still
with us in software,

349
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:47,490
is the process of looking
up someone in a phone book.

350
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:51,690
>> Now, fewer and fewer folks know each
year what this relic actually is here.

351
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:53,470
But back in my day,
this was a phone book

352
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:57,266
with thousands of pages and numbers
and people's names from A through Z.

353
00:16:57,266 --> 00:17:00,390
And even though we're kind of cheating
a bit-- this is mostly yellow pages.

354
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:01,920
There were also white
pages at the time, which

355
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,720
had all of those names and
numbers of actual human beings.

356
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,970
>> And if I wanted to look someone up in a
phone book like this today, of course,

357
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:11,010
I just type in the first few
characters of his or her name,

358
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:13,480
and my phone finds that information.

359
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,970
But the process by which
your iPhone or Android phone

360
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:18,730
or whatever is actually finding
someone in your contacts list

361
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:22,099
is identical to what we humans
probably have done for some time.

362
00:17:22,099 --> 00:17:24,260
>> Now I could take this
problem, if you will,

363
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:26,220
and the inputs here
are not zeros and ones.

364
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:28,730
They're pages-- like,
let's say 1,000 pages.

365
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:32,650
And if I wanted to look up someone
like Mike Smith in this phone book,

366
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:35,570
I could start at the beginning
and see that I'm in the A section

367
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:38,300
and then turn one page at
a time, looking and looking

368
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:42,820
as I make to the B's and the C's and
the D's and so forth for Mike Smith.

369
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:46,000
Smith starting with an S, I'll
hopefully eventually find him.

370
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,090
>> Is this algorithm--
that process-- correct?

371
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:50,590
Yeah.

372
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:51,610
It's correct.

373
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:57,040
I will find Mike if he's in here, but
what's the caveat that you might offer.

374
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:57,541
It's slow.

375
00:17:57,541 --> 00:17:58,040
Right?

376
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,975
I know Mike S is sort of toward
the latter half of the phone book.

377
00:18:00,975 --> 00:18:02,766
Why the heck am I
starting at the beginning

378
00:18:02,766 --> 00:18:04,349
and going page by page by page.

379
00:18:04,349 --> 00:18:06,890
So of course, I could flip it
around and start from the back,

380
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:08,973
but that's going to get
me there at the same rate,

381
00:18:08,973 --> 00:18:10,930
if you willl-- page
after page after page.

382
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:14,190
And it's not going to work if I want
to search for someone else whose

383
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:15,880
name comes earlier in the alphabet.

384
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,240
>> So what if I do what I
learned in grade school,

385
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,205
again, do things not
by ones but by twos.

386
00:18:19,205 --> 00:18:23,060
So 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and so forth.

387
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:23,740
Is that correct?

388
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:27,030

389
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:27,560
No.

390
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,830
It's kind of correct.

391
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:33,210
But some of you who murmured no,
where is the problem, or the bug,

392
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:34,240
the mistake so to speak.

393
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:34,580
Yeah.

394
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,570
>> STUDENT: You might skip
over the right entry.

395
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:37,320
>> DAVID MALAN: Yeah.

396
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:40,340
I might skip over Mike Smith is
because I've taken two pages at once

397
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:43,190
and he just happens to be
sandwiched between those two pages.

398
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:46,500
I might realize that
I'm on to the T section

399
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,690
not having found Mike Smith yet.

400
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:50,820
>> And so what might the fixed there be?

401
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,709
Well, if I do hit the
Ts in the phone book,

402
00:18:52,709 --> 00:18:54,500
I might need to double
back one or so page.

403
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,830
So it's fixable, but
it's not quite as simple

404
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:59,170
as just going by two to
speed up my performance.

405
00:18:59,170 --> 00:18:59,680
But what?

406
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,180
Come on.

407
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:03,530
What is what most humans are going
to do with this kind of phone book?

408
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:04,696
You're given the phone book.

409
00:19:04,696 --> 00:19:06,280
What do you do?

410
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:06,922
>> What's that?

411
00:19:06,922 --> 00:19:07,630
Go to the middle.

412
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:10,620
So I heard go to the middle, and I
find myself roughly in the M section,

413
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:11,120
so to speak.

414
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,670
And now what do I want to do?

415
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:14,077
Good job.

416
00:19:14,077 --> 00:19:14,785
What's your name?

417
00:19:14,785 --> 00:19:15,350
>> JAMES: James.

418
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:15,890
>> DAVID MALAN: James, all right.

419
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:16,829
What do I do next?

420
00:19:16,829 --> 00:19:18,620
JAMES: You go in the
half that has the S's.

421
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:18,740
DAVID MALAN: All right.

422
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,910
I'm going to go into the half that
has the S's in it because, again,

423
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:22,920
a stipulation here was
that this thing is sorted.

424
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,461
It's a pretty useless 1,000
pages if Verizon doesn't actually

425
00:19:25,461 --> 00:19:27,339
sort these things for us A through Z.

426
00:19:27,339 --> 00:19:30,130
So if I know Mike is probably in
the latter half of the phone book,

427
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:31,536
I can now.

428
00:19:31,536 --> 00:19:33,388
>> [LAUGHS]

429
00:19:33,388 --> 00:19:35,240

430
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,391
>> Tear the problem in half.

431
00:19:37,391 --> 00:19:38,615
>> [APPLAUSE]

432
00:19:38,615 --> 00:19:39,115

433
00:19:39,115 --> 00:19:40,300
Thank you.

434
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,510
Tear the problem in half.

435
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:44,440
That was actually real-- that struggle.

436
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:47,050
So tear the phone book
in half, leaving myself

437
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:48,580
with fundamentally the same problem.

438
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:50,060
But of course, half as large.

439
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:52,550
And if I follow James's
advice again, and I go here.

440
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:54,400
I say, oh now I'm in the T section.

441
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,460
>> And so of course, I
can tear the phone book

442
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:59,660
in half one more time, leaving
me with a problem that's

443
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:00,810
now a quarter of the size.

444
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:05,335
So I've gone from 1,000 to 500
to 250 to 125 and so forth.

445
00:20:05,335 --> 00:20:07,350
It feels like I'm
taking bigger bites out

446
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:10,615
of this problem with each
iteration, or each step in it.

447
00:20:10,615 --> 00:20:15,580
>> And indeed, the time I'm going to spend
finding Mike Smith in this example

448
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:18,970
is so much less because eventually I'm
going to whittle this pone book down

449
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:20,192
to just one lone page.

450
00:20:20,192 --> 00:20:23,010
And if Mike is on that page, I'm
going to go ahead and give him

451
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:24,670
a call having found him.

452
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:27,030
>> But just how much better
is that algorithm--

453
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:29,690
that dare say intuitive
algorithm-- than the ones we

454
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:34,920
started with which we're very linear--
left to right-- at a pace of 1 or 2x?

455
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,100
>> Well, let's plot this.

456
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:39,380
We don't have to worry too much about
math or numbers in this case here.

457
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:40,550
We just look at a plot.

458
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:43,600
So on the x, or horizontal axis,
is the size of the problem--

459
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,700
how many pages are there.

460
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,760
On the y, or the vertical
axis, is how much time

461
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,218
is it going to take me to solve it.

462
00:20:48,218 --> 00:20:50,760
And maybe that's how many
page turns, how many seconds,

463
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,370
how many-- some unit of measures.

464
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:57,810
>> And I've drawn a red straight lines
here because if each additional page

465
00:20:57,810 --> 00:21:01,740
of the phone book, I require
to make one additional step.

466
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,680
So if Verizon adds one
more page next year,

467
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:06,970
I might have to flip one more page
to find someone like Mike Smith.

468
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:11,340
>> Meanwhile, the second algorithm, which
I went by twos, is the same shape.

469
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:15,220
It's still very linear, very left to
right, taking equal bytes each time,

470
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:16,900
but the slope is a little lower.

471
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:23,590
>> For instance, if the size of
the problem were roughly here

472
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:25,990
and I used my first algorithm,
I might end up all the way

473
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:27,480
at the top of that red line.

474
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,390
But if I instead use
to twosies approach,

475
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:31,480
the yellow line suggests
because it's lower,

476
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,790
that it's going to take
me less time the solve.

477
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:37,400
>> But what's the shape of the
third algorithm-- again, arguably

478
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,707
the most intuitive algorithm?

479
00:21:38,707 --> 00:21:40,540
Well, it looks a little
something like this.

480
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:43,480
It's curved, or logarithmic, in shape.

481
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:46,510
And even though it never
kind of flattens out,

482
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:50,770
it asymptotically inches up and
up and up but terribly slowly

483
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:52,129
versus everything else.

484
00:21:52,129 --> 00:21:53,170
And what's the take away?

485
00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:54,215
Well, we call it log n.

486
00:21:54,215 --> 00:21:55,820
But what does that actually mean?

487
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:58,580
Well if Verizon doubled the
number of pages in the phone book

488
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:00,810
next year from 1,000 to 2,000.

489
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:04,600
How many more steps is my
first algorithm going to take?

490
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,440
>> My first algorithm.

491
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,399
Maybe 1,000 more steps.

492
00:22:06,399 --> 00:22:08,106
If they doubled the
phone book, I'm going

493
00:22:08,106 --> 00:22:10,590
to have to flip through another
1,000 pages to find Mike.

494
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:13,240
Of course, if the second
algorithm, maybe 500 because I'm

495
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,610
going twice as fast.

496
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:18,380
>> But if Verizon doubles the number
of pages between this year and next,

497
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:21,650
with my third algorithm-- the divide
and conquer that James proposed,

498
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:24,450
going in half and half and
half-- how many more steps will

499
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:29,030
it take me next year to have
a phone book of a size 2,000?

500
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:29,670
Just one.

501
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:34,110
Because with one bite, I can take,
out of that problem, half of the pages

502
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:34,694
away.

503
00:22:34,694 --> 00:22:37,860
And if you think about this a little
crazily now-- if the phone book doesn't

504
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:41,810
have 1,000 or 2000 page, but
let's say 4 billion pages--

505
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:45,282
it's a big phone book-- how
many times or how many steps

506
00:22:45,282 --> 00:22:47,740
is it going to take me to find
Mike Smith in the phone book

507
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:50,489
with 4 billion pages.

508
00:22:50,489 --> 00:22:52,030
You can sort of start to do the math.

509
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:52,200
All right.

510
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,175
4 billion divided by 2.

511
00:22:53,175 --> 00:22:54,550
So that's 2 billion divided by 1.

512
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:55,510
That's 1 billion.

513
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:56,410
Then half a billion.

514
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:59,940
Then 250-- so you can do this again and
again but not that many times before

515
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:01,020
you get to one page.

516
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:04,360
>> And indeed, even if the phone
book is 4 billion pages long

517
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:08,340
or the database you're searching
is 4 billion records long,

518
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:12,720
it's going to take you give or take
32 steps only to find Mike Smith.

519
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,990
And if you double the phone book next
year from 4 billion to 8 billion,

520
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:19,010
33 steps instead of just 32.

521
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:21,100
>> And this is testament
to one of the ideas

522
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:24,100
that we might embrace in computer
science more generally, which

523
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:26,760
is this computational thinking
and approaching a problem

524
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:29,479
frankly using tools from
your already familiar tool

525
00:23:29,479 --> 00:23:31,520
kit-- your real world with
which you're familiar,

526
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,730
but harnessing those ideas
to actually solve problems.

527
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:37,200
>> But we need to formalize our
solutions to these problems.

528
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,200
And so let me introduce for a moment
something we might call pseudocode.

529
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:44,260
Much of the semester, we'll spend using
actual code in languages like C and PHP

530
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:46,570
and JavaScript and SQL and the like.

531
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:49,000
>> But for now, let's just look
at something fairly intuitive

532
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:49,930
like English.

533
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:52,490
I might distill that
algorithm with which

534
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:54,650
I found Mike into steps like this.

535
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:55,760
>> Pick up the phone book

536
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,121
>> Open to middle of phone book

537
00:23:57,121 --> 00:23:57,870
Look at the name's

538
00:23:57,870 --> 00:23:59,290
If Mike is among the name's

539
00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:00,450
Call Mike

540
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:02,290
Else if Smith is earlier in the book

541
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:04,540
Open to the middle of
the left half of the book

542
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:06,244
Else go to line 3

543
00:24:06,244 --> 00:24:07,660
Else if Smith is later in the book

544
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:09,330
Open to the middle of the
right half of the book

545
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:09,996
Go to line three

546
00:24:09,996 --> 00:24:10,720
Else

547
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,500
Give up

548
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:15,360
And there's a few characteristics now
of this that are worth pointing out.

549
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,370
So one, all the lines
I've highlighted in yellow

550
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:21,430
we're going to start calling
statements or functions or procedures.

551
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:24,160
They're just actions do
this, and there's not

552
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,400
all that much variability to it.

553
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,850
>> Next step here though, are these
conditions-- if, else, else if, else.

554
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:34,020
And these are called conditions, or
branches, and they're decision points.

555
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:36,780
And they allow us to do
something conditionally.

556
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:39,650
>> And in fact, let's take a quick
look at perhaps a familiar face--

557
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:43,380
we'll call him Bill-- and
exactly what these conditions,

558
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:45,670
how these might be used.

559
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:48,230
>> BILL GATES: People make
decisions every day.

560
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:51,800
For example, before you go outside you
kind of have an if statement that says,

561
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:55,650
if it's raining, then I
need to get my jacket.

562
00:24:55,650 --> 00:25:00,990
>> And computers are amazing once you
decide those kinds of statements

563
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:06,450
that they can reliably execute
those things at unbelievable speed.

564
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:12,470
And so a computer program really
is a little bit of math and some

565
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:16,890
if statements where
the decision gets made.

566
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:19,432
>> DAVID MALAN: So now let's focus
on a few different lines--

567
00:25:19,432 --> 00:25:21,140
the ones I've highlighted
in yellow here.

568
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:23,890
And it turns out there's different
ways of expressing this idea.

569
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:28,550
But intuitively what our lines 8 and 11
that I've highlighted here telling you

570
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:29,100
to do?

571
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:33,081
Yes, go to line 3, but what
behavior is that really inducing?

572
00:25:33,081 --> 00:25:35,580
It's some kind of loop or cycle,
and you can kind of see it.

573
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:36,079
Right?

574
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:39,710
If on line 8, you go back to line
3, and then you hit line 8 again,

575
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:42,700
you might go back to line 3,
back to line 3, back to line 3.

576
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,530
There's this sort of cycle or loop.

577
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:47,177
And indeed, that's induced in
line 11 potentially as well.

578
00:25:47,177 --> 00:25:49,260
And this is a basic
programming construct as well.

579
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:51,593
>> You might not want to just
do something with a statement

580
00:25:51,593 --> 00:25:54,280
or do something conditionally
with a condition or branch.

581
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,644
You might want to do something
cyclically with a loop.

582
00:25:56,644 --> 00:25:59,810
And we'll have someone else with whom
you might be familiar-- we'll call him

583
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:02,996
Mark-- explain this concept here.

584
00:26:02,996 --> 00:26:04,870
MARK ZUCKERBERG: One
thing that computers are

585
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:07,460
really good at is repeating commands.

586
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:09,510
As a person, you'd get
really bored if you

587
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:12,310
had to do the same thing
lots of times in a row,

588
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:16,230
but a computer can do the same thing
millions or even billions of times

589
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:18,930
and not get bored and be able
to carry that out really well.

590
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:21,240
>> So for example, if I
want to wish everyone

591
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:24,450
on Facebook a happy birthday
by sending them an email,

592
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:27,037
it might take me more than a
century to actually write out

593
00:26:27,037 --> 00:26:28,370
all of those emails to everyone.

594
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:33,500
But with just a few lines of code, I can
have a system send an email to everyone

595
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,460
on Facebook wishing
them a happy birthday.

596
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:38,330
>> So that's what loops are and why
they're valuable and something

597
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:40,076
that computers can do very well.

598
00:26:40,076 --> 00:26:43,109
>> DAVID MALAN: Many thanks to our friends
at code.org for those two films.

599
00:26:43,109 --> 00:26:46,150
And just last week, you might have
seen that Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook

600
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:47,940
posted this announcement,
which is that they just

601
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:50,398
have passed an important
milestone for the first time ever.

602
00:26:50,398 --> 00:26:54,320
1 billion people used Facebook in a
single day, specifically last Monday.

603
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:58,650
One in seven humans on Earth
apparently logged into Facebook.

604
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:03,310
>> Well, this seems a good opportunity
to look back on where Facebook began,

605
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:06,840
and we went through CS50's own
archives because it turns out in 2005,

606
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:10,020
Mark gave a guest lecture in CS50.

607
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:13,870
You'll see that production values
weren't quite the same back then

608
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:16,110
in terms of the technology
available, and you'll also

609
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:18,310
see that the presence
of this guest lecture

610
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:22,470
didn't necessarily pique the interest
of the student body, your predecessors,

611
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:24,910
as much as it might have
just a few years later.

612
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:27,902
>> So let's take a look
at Science Center C.

613
00:27:27,902 --> 00:27:29,389

614
00:27:29,389 --> 00:27:31,014
SPEAKER 2: Please join me, and welcome.

615
00:27:31,014 --> 00:27:33,374

616
00:27:33,374 --> 00:27:36,577
[APPLAUSE]

617
00:27:36,577 --> 00:27:37,410
MARK ZUCKERBERG: Yo.

618
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:37,900
All right.

619
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:40,420
Cool this is the first time I've ever
have had to hold one of these things.

620
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:42,336
So I'm just going to
attach it really quickly.

621
00:27:42,336 --> 00:27:54,354

622
00:27:54,354 --> 00:27:54,854
All right.

623
00:27:54,854 --> 00:27:57,314
Can you hear it?

624
00:27:57,314 --> 00:27:58,298
Is this good?

625
00:27:58,298 --> 00:28:00,684
Is this amplified at all?

626
00:28:00,684 --> 00:28:01,184
All right.

627
00:28:01,184 --> 00:28:02,040
Sweet.

628
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:06,860
So, this is like one of the first times
I've been to a lecture at Harvard,

629
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:08,660
but--

630
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:12,510
>> DAVID MALAN: So eventually the Science
Center did zoom in on the video,

631
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:15,110
but not before capturing this
excerpt where Mark's talking,

632
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:18,230
which he discussed his
roommate, Dustin, who

633
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:20,885
wanted to lend a hand with this
site called the Facebook.com

634
00:28:20,885 --> 00:28:24,540
and realized that Mark is about to
mention to programming languages--

635
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:27,290
one called Perl, one
called PHP-- as he discusses

636
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:28,840
the origins of Dustin's contribution.

637
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,499

638
00:28:31,499 --> 00:28:33,290
MARK ZUCKERBERG: I
started running the site

639
00:28:33,290 --> 00:28:37,770
and launched it at
Harvard in February, 2004.

640
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:39,540
So I guess almost two years ago now.

641
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:42,322
And within a couple of weeks, a
few thousand people had signed up,

642
00:28:42,322 --> 00:28:45,280
and we started getting some emails
from people at other colleges asking

643
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:47,520
for us to launch it at their schools.

644
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,455
>> And I was taking 161 at the time.

645
00:28:49,455 --> 00:28:52,080
So I don't know if you guys know
the reputation of that course,

646
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,402
but it was kind of heavy.

647
00:28:54,402 --> 00:28:57,110
It was a really fun course, but
it didn't leave me with much time

648
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:59,260
to do anything else with Facebook.

649
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:04,309
So my roommate Dustin, who I guess
had just finished CS50, was like, hey.

650
00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:05,100
I want to help out.

651
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:08,760
I want to do the expansion and help
you figure out how to do the stuff.

652
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,780
>> So I was like, that's pretty cool, dude.

653
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:13,130
But you don't really know any
PHP or anything like that.

654
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:16,444
So that weekend he went home,
bought the book Perl for Dummies,

655
00:29:16,444 --> 00:29:17,860
came back and was like, all right.

656
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:18,940
I'm ready to go.

657
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:23,010
>> I was like, dude, the site's written
in PHP not Perl, but that's cool.

658
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:28,530
>> So he picked up PHP over
like a few days because I

659
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:30,790
promise that if you have
a good background in C,

660
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:32,970
PHP is a very simple thing to pick up.

661
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:37,480
And he just kind of went to work.

662
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:40,500
>> Before we take a look now at
where the course is going,

663
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:43,047
allow me to invite just some
of SC50's staff up on to stage.

664
00:29:43,047 --> 00:29:44,880
Some of them are shopping
their own courses.

665
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:48,390
But if those TFs and CAs and course
heads who are here could come on up

666
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:50,230
and join me for a quick hello.

667
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:54,670
>> Allow me to introduce in particular,
Hanna, Maria, Daven, and Rob,

668
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:59,666
CS50's course heads here in Cambridge.

669
00:29:59,666 --> 00:30:02,106
>> [APPLAUSE]

670
00:30:02,106 --> 00:30:07,490

671
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:11,060
>> DAVID MALAN: Indeed, testament to the
support structure that the course has

672
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:15,660
built out over the past many years,
CS50 staff this year numbers nearly 100,

673
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:17,170
and that's here in Cambridge alone.

674
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:21,240
Meanwhile, in New Haven, are there some
40 TFs and CAs and staff members there

675
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,800
to run the course as well.

676
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:26,125
>> Allow us to introduce first, Rob Bowden.

677
00:30:26,125 --> 00:30:26,750
ROB BOWDEN: Hi.

678
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:27,620
I'm Rob.

679
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:32,750
This is my sixth year
TFing in the course.

680
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:37,970
So, all the way back in my
freshman year, I did not take CS50.

681
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:40,270
Your freshman fall--
you might be familiar

682
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:43,270
that you can only take four courses
and there are so many courses today.

683
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:44,450
So I'm like, eh.

684
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:48,050
I took AP CS my senior year of
high school it was horrible.

685
00:30:48,050 --> 00:30:48,900
So, I'm like, eh.

686
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,380
Computer science is not for me.

687
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:53,000
>> So then it was over the
course of my freshman

688
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:58,960
fall, that I had a friend in CS50, and
I think I attended one lecture with her.

689
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:03,760
It's like, oh, this is kind of better
than what I had in high school.

690
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,990
>> And over the course of the
year, I had my own problem sets

691
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,750
in the courses I was actually taking.

692
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:11,870
But I found that whenever I
wanted to procrastinate on those,

693
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:15,111
I would go back to CS50 and
look at some of that stuff.

694
00:31:15,111 --> 00:31:15,610
So, yeah.

695
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:16,140
I'm cool.

696
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:19,350
I procrastination with coding.

697
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:22,910
So then it's at the end of
the fall that I realize, hey,

698
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:24,410
computer science is pretty cool.

699
00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:27,730
I end up taking CS51.

700
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:30,430
In the next semester,
I end up taking CS61.

701
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:32,727
And it all from there,
then I end up declaring

702
00:31:32,727 --> 00:31:35,310
computer science, which I had
absolutely no intention of doing

703
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,740
when I came into college.

704
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:39,330
And now I'm here.

705
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:42,230
So the course is what you make of it.

706
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:43,463
I hope you enjoy it.

707
00:31:43,463 --> 00:31:44,066
>> [APPLAUSE]

708
00:31:44,066 --> 00:31:45,315
DAVID MALAN: Thank you to Rob.

709
00:31:45,315 --> 00:31:49,020

710
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:52,180
>> And now Maria, our
head course assistant.

711
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:53,140
>> MARIA: Hey guys.

712
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:53,880
My name is Maria.

713
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:56,930
I'm a sophomore in Cabot
House, coming from Bulgaria,

714
00:31:56,930 --> 00:31:59,880
and I'm super excited to be
part of the staff this year.

715
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:03,380
I took CS50 as a freshman
last year, and I never even

716
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:04,750
thought about CS beforehand.

717
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:08,380
So I absolutely love the course, and I
hope you all love it as much as I did.

718
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:09,250
And, yeah.

719
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:10,868
Welcome to CS50.

720
00:32:10,868 --> 00:32:12,201
DAVID MALAN: Thank you to Maria.

721
00:32:12,201 --> 00:32:13,674
[APPLAUSE]

722
00:32:13,674 --> 00:32:16,129

723
00:32:16,129 --> 00:32:19,580
Now Hanna, our head teaching fellow.

724
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:20,480
HANNA: Hi, I'm Hanna.

725
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,990
I'm a senior in Cabot
studying computer science.

726
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:28,120
I took CS50 as a freshman and had
been TFing-- this'll be my third year.

727
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:31,000
So I will be happily involved
in CS50 for all four years,

728
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,569
and I'm looking forward
to working with you all.

729
00:32:33,569 --> 00:32:34,902
DAVID MALAN: Thank you to Hanna.

730
00:32:34,902 --> 00:32:36,870
[APPLAUSE]

731
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:37,854

732
00:32:37,854 --> 00:32:40,274
And lastly, Daven, our precepter.

733
00:32:40,274 --> 00:32:40,940
DAVEN: Hey guys.

734
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:42,390
I'm a precept over in
computer science here.

735
00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:44,010
This'll be my fourth year teaching.

736
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:45,261
I also help manage the course.

737
00:32:45,261 --> 00:32:47,801
So I'm sure you'll see me around,
especially at office hours.

738
00:32:47,801 --> 00:32:48,970
I'm always at office hours.

739
00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:51,640
So if you see me walking
around, definitely come say hi.

740
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:52,681
I love to meet everybody.

741
00:32:52,681 --> 00:32:55,830
Otherwise, have fun,
and I'll see you around.

742
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:58,210
>> DAVID MALAN: Thank you to Daven as well.

743
00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:01,290
So you'll meet all of
these folks before long.

744
00:33:01,290 --> 00:33:03,040
But without further
ado, if you guys would

745
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:05,840
like to resume your seats from earlier.

746
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:10,940
Allow me to introduce from afar now
some of our friends from New Haven,

747
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:14,690
in particular the course's heads who'll
be overseeing CS50 there-- Professor

748
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:19,550
Brian Scassellati, Jason, and Andi,
who just-- so that we didn't tempt fate

749
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:22,610
with any FaceTime or the like--
have just sent us minutes

750
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:27,380
ago the following video in which
they say hello from lecture hall

751
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:31,480
at Yale, in which lecture
is being streamed right now.

752
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:34,052
>> So our friends from Yale.

753
00:33:34,052 --> 00:33:35,260
BRIAN SCASSELLATI: Hi, David.

754
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:36,480
Hi, everyone at Harvard.

755
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:41,400
We are so excited to be bringing
CS50 to Yale this semester.

756
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:45,250
My name is Brian Scassellati,
but everyone just calls me Scas.

757
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:50,402
And I'm here today to introduce
to you the CS50 staff.

758
00:33:50,402 --> 00:33:52,346
>> [CHEERING]

759
00:33:52,346 --> 00:33:55,760

760
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:59,780
>> And more importantly, I'm
here to introduce as well

761
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:03,690
all of the students at
Yale who as of this morning

762
00:34:03,690 --> 00:34:09,289
have made this the most popular
course at Yale the CS50 students.

763
00:34:09,289 --> 00:34:12,090
>> [CHEERING]

764
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:25,850

765
00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:28,310
>> So we're very excited
to be seeing you here

766
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:34,239
on Friday and on Saturday for
Puzzle Day and have a great lecture.

767
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,440
Bye.

768
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,360
>> [APPLAUSE]

769
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:42,170

770
00:34:42,170 --> 00:34:45,497
>> DAVID MALAN: On the screen here is
the names of the some of 140 staff

771
00:34:45,497 --> 00:34:48,330
members who await you over the
course of the semester-- some of them

772
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:50,540
here in Cambridge, some
of them here in New Haven.

773
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:52,706
And indeed you'll have an
opportunity this Saturday,

774
00:34:52,706 --> 00:34:54,530
as Scas notes, to
attend CS50 Puzzle Day.

775
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:57,780
You might have seen little puzzle pieces
slipped under your doorways recently.

776
00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:00,420
We have a few extras here
later on when you exist.

777
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:04,030
If you assemble all four puzzle
pieces and merge forces with rooms

778
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:06,450
nearby yours in your
house or dorm, they'll

779
00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:09,690
assemble into a QR code-- or a
two dimensional bar code, that

780
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:12,970
once assembled and scanned
with your phone will lead you

781
00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:17,060
to some fabulous prize or-- I suppose
you could just photograph this now

782
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:17,560
as well.

783
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:22,560
>> But find those puzzle pieces nonetheless
in order to win that fabulous prize.

784
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:25,900
And indeed one of the traditions
in SC50-- ah, too slow.

785
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:29,790
One of the traditions in CS50 is to
serve cake after the first lecture.

786
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:31,620
>> And so indeed, in a
few minutes from now,

787
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:36,040
there will be cake served outside
both here and New Haven as well.

788
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:39,530
>> But first-- we decorated them ourselves.

789
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:43,360
But first-- and hopefully
there'll be enough.

790
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,830
>> But first, a quick look.

791
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:47,880
So lectures is indeed will be
produced mostly here in Cambridge.

792
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:51,580
But each month, we'll hop down to Yale
with CS50's production team and stream

793
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:53,730
the course in the reverse
direction as well so

794
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:56,840
as to bring these two campuses
truly for the first time in history

795
00:35:56,840 --> 00:36:00,450
as close together as possible
as one in the same course.

796
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:04,050
>> In terms of the support structure that's
been stood up here in Cambridge as well

797
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:05,646
as in New Haven, are sections.

798
00:36:05,646 --> 00:36:08,020
Indeed, as some of you may
know, we have different tracks

799
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:10,850
within the course for those less
comfortable, more comfortable,

800
00:36:10,850 --> 00:36:14,610
and somewhere in between so that
irrespective of your prior background,

801
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:17,670
can you ultimately succeed in the class.

802
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:21,320
>> Office hours meanwhile, are an
opportunity on Mondays and Tuesdays

803
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:26,570
and Thursday evenings to work both
here and in New Haven on our course's

804
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:30,370
problem sets with dozens of
the course's staff near you.

805
00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:35,380
>> Problem sets meanwhile, are
supported by things we call

806
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:39,140
walkthroughs, which are video based
tutorials that truly answering FAQ

807
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:41,670
of where to begin a week's challenge.

808
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:44,290
And postmortems walk you
through possible solutions

809
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:46,490
so that the end of the
problem set too, you

810
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:50,820
know exactly what you could have done
differently or altogether otherwise.

811
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:53,895
>> The problem sets themselves come
in two editions, a standard edition

812
00:36:53,895 --> 00:36:57,510
that we expect and invite most of
the class-- some 90% plus to do--

813
00:36:57,510 --> 00:37:00,520
and a so-called hacker edition
on which every page is emblazoned

814
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,790
hacker edition, hacker
edition, hacker edition,

815
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:07,550
so that you have that karma
if you will, for diving

816
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:10,230
into more advanced versions
of the course's problem sets

817
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:14,970
that cover ostensibly the same material
but with a more sophisticated approach

818
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:19,020
and with additional background
sometimes introduced.

819
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:22,350
>> Meanwhile, are there nine late days that
you can apply to the course's problem

820
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:26,160
sets as well as the lowest score,
which we drop at the terms end.

821
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:26,900
>> But what awaits?

822
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:29,300
Well, a taste of the problem
sets at hand on Friday

823
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:31,959
and next week where we dabble
for just a few days in something

824
00:37:31,959 --> 00:37:35,000
called Scratch, a graphical programming
language developed by our friends

825
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:39,290
at MIT's Media Lab that allows you
to program either for the first time

826
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:43,510
or in a new environment altogether
using a drag and drop type environment.

827
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:45,595
Whereby puzzle pieces
only interlock together

828
00:37:45,595 --> 00:37:48,080
if it makes logical sense to do so.

829
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:50,440
>> Meanwhile in problem set
two last year for instance,

830
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:53,010
did we introduce the class
to the world of cryptography,

831
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:55,370
the art of encrypting or
scrambling information.

832
00:37:55,370 --> 00:37:58,940
Indeed, this text here if
decrypted, will actually

833
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:01,277
lead you to some fun destination.

834
00:38:01,277 --> 00:38:03,110
And in the problem set,
what we had students

835
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:06,280
do is implement exactly those
kinds of things-- an algorithm,

836
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:09,530
or set of instructions for scrambling
and scrambling information.

837
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:11,850
>> And in the hacker edition
of that same problem set,

838
00:38:11,850 --> 00:38:15,800
did we challenge students to take a
encrypted file from a typical computer

839
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:18,840
system with lots of usernames
and encrypted passwords

840
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:21,400
and to crack those passwords--
actually figure out

841
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:25,870
what they were without knowing anything
a priori about those actual passwords.

842
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:27,620
Meanwhile, do we
transition in the problem

843
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:29,536
sets to then looking at
the world of graphics.

844
00:38:29,536 --> 00:38:32,240
And in fact, you might imagine
now that this could perhaps

845
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:35,200
be the simplest way to represent
a black and white image.

846
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:39,570
>> A white pixel, or square,
as at top right there,

847
00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:41,620
might be represented with
a 1 and a black square

848
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:43,490
might be represented with a 0.

849
00:38:43,490 --> 00:38:47,670
And just by using more bits like we
proposed earlier with 72 and 73 and 33,

850
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:49,882
could we represent color pixels as well.

851
00:38:49,882 --> 00:38:51,590
And what we do during
this problem set is

852
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:54,660
generally take a stroll around
campus with a digital camera,

853
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:56,730
take photographs of
people, places, and things.

854
00:38:56,730 --> 00:38:59,270
Then somehow every semester,
we seem to accidentally

855
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:02,600
deleted or corrupt the memory card
on which all of those photos are,

856
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,610
and so you are challenged
to then write software

857
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:09,650
with which to recover those JPEGs
from a copy of our camera's card.

858
00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:13,550
>> Meanwhile, do we hand you later in
the term a dictionary of English words

859
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:16,680
that have 143,000 words,
and you need to come up

860
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:19,240
with a smart way of
loading them into memory,

861
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:22,850
or RAM so to speak, to answer
queries of the form: is this a word,

862
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:25,910
is this a word, implementing the
fastest spell checker that you can,

863
00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:28,180
even pinning yourself
potentially against classmates

864
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:30,460
to see which of you uses
the least amount of time

865
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:33,440
when running your code and even
the least amount of memory.

866
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:36,060
>> Later in term do you actually
implement your own web server.

867
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:39,470
So not just a website in a
language called HTML and more,

868
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:43,300
but a web server that actually
listens to requests on the internet

869
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:44,460
and responds to them.

870
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:47,210
And indeed, this is how we bridge
our world of C with which you'll

871
00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:50,550
become familiar next week and
PHP and HTML and JavaScript

872
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:51,820
and CSS and the like.

873
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:54,820
>> Because one of the first web based
project we do later in the term

874
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:57,516
is historically CS50 Finance.

875
00:39:57,516 --> 00:40:02,580
Etrade.com style a website that allows
you to buy and sell stocks virtually

876
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:08,240
while also writing code to talk to Yahoo
Finance getting semi real time stock

877
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:11,490
quotes in order to update
your own portfolio.

878
00:40:11,490 --> 00:40:13,370
>> But lastly of course,
is the final project--

879
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:16,960
an opportunity to do most anything of
interest to you to solve a problem here

880
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:20,970
or beyond of interest to
you that's somehow inspired

881
00:40:20,970 --> 00:40:22,670
by the lessons learned in the class.

882
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:26,140
>> And the class, as you may know,
culminates in so-called CS50 Hackathon

883
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:29,330
and CS50 Fair and any number
of other cultural events

884
00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:31,770
throughout the semester
that allow you to engage

885
00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:33,460
with each other and the course's staff.

886
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:37,170
>> For instance, at Fire and Ice in Sitar
this year, well, on Friday afternoons,

887
00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:39,220
we invite some 50
students to lunch, whoever

888
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:41,190
would like to join us,
myself, and the staff,

889
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:44,840
and our friends from industry and alums
to chat about life in the real world

890
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,670
and beyond while enjoying a good lunch.

891
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:49,050
At the Hackathon will
you see such images

892
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:53,740
as these, including plenty of candy--
and as of 2014 for the first time--

893
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:55,096
vegetables.

894
00:40:55,096 --> 00:40:56,960
>> [APPLAUSE]

895

896
00:40:58,358 --> 00:41:02,710
>> But by 5:00 AM, does the scene usually
look a little something like this.

897
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:05,330
And then just a week or
so later, is the CS50 Fair

898
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:08,270
to which some 2000 plus
students and staff and faculty

899
00:41:08,270 --> 00:41:11,910
members from across campus
and across campuses this year

900
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:15,620
come to see and delight in the
accomplishments of CS50 students, which

901
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:16,140
is now you.

902
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:19,000
>> And indeed, while this year we'll
be inviting and busing anyone

903
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,460
at at Yale who would like to come up to
Cambridge this Saturday for CS50 Puzzle

904
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:26,410
Day, and we'll do the exact same thing
in December for the CS50 Hackathon

905
00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:30,080
so that Harvard and Yale students
alike partake in both of these events.

906
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:33,630
>> We will also hold CS50 fairs in
Cambridge and in New Haven this year

907
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:36,480
so that students on both
campuses and staff and faculty

908
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:39,260
can see each respective
campus's accomplishment.

909
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:41,540
And those accomplishments
will induce such memory

910
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:45,440
as this and this and ultimately
this, in which all of you

911
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:48,460
exit the class wearing a little
something in which you were hopefully

912
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:52,680
happy or proud to say that I took CS50.

913
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:55,220
>> But before that and
before we serve cake,

914
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:58,980
we've put together-- thanks to CS50's
production team and a certain self

915
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:03,120
stick, the one occasion that we use
such things for-- when we sent it

916
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:05,380
not only here to Cambridge
but also to New Haven

917
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:08,760

course's staff and all of the folks

918
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:12,640

I'm excited to teach
CS50 because I think

950
00:43:08,310 --> 00:43:11,429
it bring computer science to
people in and approachable way.

I think it's a fun and creative way

There's always something exciting.

00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:43,077
There's always new challenges faced by
new students, and it's fun to help them

965
00:43:43,077 --> 00:43:44,910
and to experience those
challenges with them

966
00:43:44,910 --> 00:43:45,925

learned how to do CS,

968
00:43:47,955 --> 00:43:49,413
it was like learning a super power.

00:43:49,413 --> 00:43:53,749
And to see that in other students
and to help them through that process

970
00:43:53,749 --> 00:43:55,665
is one of the most
rewarding things I've ever.

971
00:43:55,665 --> 00:43:58,706
>> SPEAKER 7: I chose CS because in the
beginning, I was a math concentrator

972
00:43:58,706 --> 00:44:00,497
and I took CS50 and
fell in love with it.

973
00:44:00,497 --> 00:44:02,455
I also felt that with
CS, I could build things.
